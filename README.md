# Version system
Pre-release versions will use the following version system </br>
Beta x Build y

Release versions will use something similar to the semantic versioning system, more information can be found here: https://semver.org/

# Early Beta (beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3 build 1 and 2)
Not currently available as I have only just revived the project, I will be prioritising new versions however you can still play early betas (if you really want to) on the scratch website, which requires flash player.

# Beta 3 build 3
Most recent version and the last version before the rewrite
Due to Scratch changing rupture.io from a .sb formot (Scratch 1.4) to a .sb3 (Scratch 3) I will be unable to convert it to a .exe or a .jar and therefore if you want to play this version you will have to play it through scratch.mit.edu

# Beta 4
Will be a complete rewrite of the game, I will be working on that over the next few days (as of 19/06/2019). Expect beta 4 build 1 within a week. As a result of the rewrite, many features will be missing from Beta 4 Build 1 and will be added as time goes on, this is mostly due to my terrible code writing and the fact that since it has been 3 years since I last saw the code, I probably won't understand what I was thinking.
