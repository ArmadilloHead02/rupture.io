# Version system
Pre-release versions will use the following version system
Beta x Build y

Release versions will use something similar to the semantic versioning system, more information can be found here: https://semver.org/

# Early Beta (beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3 build 1 and 2)
Not currently available as I have only just revived the project, I will be prioritising new versions however you can still play early betas (if you really want to) on the scratch website, which requires flash player.

# Beta 3 build 3
Most recent version and the last version before the rewrite
Download ruptureiob3b3.exe for windows
Download ruptureiob3b3.jar for Mac/Linux (requires java)

# Beta 4
Will be a complete rewrite of the game, I will be working on that over the next few days (as of 19/06/2019). Expect beta 4 build 1 within a week.
